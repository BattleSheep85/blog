# Coverage gate for the pure-logic layer — zero npm, uses Node's built-in V8
# coverage. Exits non-zero if any threshold is missed. Run: bash scripts/coverage.sh
#
# Scope = the deterministic, runtime-free modules (validation, scoring, faceting,
# URL/affiliate tagging, pure render helpers). I/O modules (db, classifier, search
# providers, handlers, engine LLM, full SSR pages) need the Cloudflare runtime and
# are integration code — out of this unit-coverage target by design.
#
# Most modules sit at 100% line. Two known gaps keep the total just under it:
#   - affiliate-links.js has ONE unreachable defensive catch (the URL is
#     pre-validated by isValidHttpsUrl, so the inner new URL() cannot throw).
#   - smtp.js openCloudflareSocket() imports 'cloudflare:sockets', which plain
#     Node cannot load. Everything below that 3-line adapter is covered through
#     the injected-socket seam.
# Thresholds are set just under the real number so a regression fails the gate
# while those two known gaps do not.
