/**
 * Assigns credibility tags + a 0-100 score to a source. Higher = more trustworthy.
 *
 * Scoring (base 50, clamped [0, 100]):
 *   + 25 hands-on testing detected
 *   + 15 expert review domain
 *   +  5 community discussion (reddit/HN/etc.)
 *   + 10 self-funded purchase disclosed (independence-positive)
 *   - 30 listicle / thin SEO content
 *   - 45 affiliate-tracked outbound links (conflict of interest)
 *   - 30 sponsored / paid-promotion markers (#ad, paid partnership)
 *   - 25 incentivized review (free/discounted product for a review)
 *   - 20 clickbait curiosity-gap framing
 *   - 15 manufacturer/retailer page (informational, not a review)
 *   - 10 reviewer under a review/press embargo or NDA
 *   +  0 seeded-unit loaner disclosed — tag only, does NOT move credibility
 *        (honest, standard practice; it only lowers `independence`)
 *
 * The sponsored/clickbait penalties are moderate on purpose: a single soft
 * signal must not, on its own, push a genuine expert-domain source (+15, or
 * +40 with hands-on) below the MIN_CREDIBLE_SCORE (45) gate.
 *
 * Also returns `independence` (0-100), a SEPARATE spectrum from `score` — see
 * the header comment for the concept. A disclosed loaner lowers independence
 * without touching credibility; free-for-review and embargo/NDA hit both.
